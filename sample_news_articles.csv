"PALM BEACH, FL—Pushing a hastily packed steamer trunk filled with clothes and money aboard his yacht before setting sail for the open seas, a desperate Donald Trump reportedly fled Friday for the remote island of Manhattan. “It’ll be a long journey—almost 10 days, by my count—but they’ll never think to look for me somewhere as far-flung as Manhattan,” said the former president, whose attempt to evade the authorities reportedly hinged on his hope that he would be entirely out of U.S. jurisdiction the moment he set foot on the pristine sand of the island’s beach. “Hell, the locals there probably don’t even read the news. Once I get a little sun and a few of the island’s delicacies in me, I bet I won’t even be worrying about this little indictment.” At press time, Trump was reportedly speculating that upon his arrival, he would be greeted as a savior by the island’s chieftain and allowed to marry his beautiful daughter.WatchRon DeSantis Introduces New Son Barron Trump

"WASHINGTON—In a heartwarming and touching end to the story of two soulmates, sources confirmed Thursday that President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump died two minutes apart holding hands. “Only minutes before their deaths, they requested that their hospital beds be pushed together—it’s like they knew what was coming,” said Marlene Kato, a nurse who confirmed that medical staff at Walter Reed Medical Center, where the two presidents spent their final hours together,  were stunned when Biden died at 8:05 p.m. and Trump followed at 8:07. “They were rivals in life, but they came together with love in death. They were both very weak, but turned their heads to face each other and smiled. Biden said, ‘You were the only one who ever got me,’ and Trump said, ‘I know.’ I started tearing up right there and then. It was just so beautiful. Then they used their final breaths to request a shared burial plot at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.” At press time, a coroner’s report revealed that Trump had strangled Biden and then succumbed to a heart attack two minutes later.

"On the 20th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, it’s important for us as a nation to reflect on that conflict and its consequences. As the vice president of the United States in 2003, I was one of the architects of the project to go after Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction. Today, I believe it’s important to offer an honest assessment of my role in the Iraq War. Looking back on it now, I have to say that, wow, I mostly got it right.Seriously, the Iraq War went basically as well as I could have hoped.AdvertisementWe in the Bush administration justified the war on the basis of destroying Saddam’s WMDs and bringing democracy to the Iraqi people. Twenty years later, we know that Saddam didn’t have any WMDs, and that the United States left Iraq in the throes of poverty and violence. Critics then and now have suggested that we deliberately misrepresented intelligence, and that spreading democracy was merely a fig leaf for our true goal of maintaining U.S. political and economic dominance over the world.To that, I say, no shit. Duh. Of course we were lying. Of course we only went in to maintain American hegemony. That was the whole plan all along. Christ, what country do you think we are?In hindsight, it’s stunning to see how right I was about the long-term impacts of invading Iraq. Sure, there are the obvious wins of destabilizing governments we don’t like, strengthening U.S. control over the oil industry, and killing a bunch of Muslims. That was all pretty neat, and exactly what we expected. But let’s be honest about the Iraqi victims: You don’t care about them, and I don’t care about them. Because, ultimately, the goal of the Iraq War was much bigger than that, and we achieved that goal: the victory of the U.S. war machine over the American people.AdvertisementIn my heart of hearts, I figured that if Americans would accept the Iraq War, then there was nothing they wouldn’t accept. It seems clear, 20 years later, that I’ve been proven right.For starters, we wanted to put the American political and media class on a permanent war footing. After the Soviet Union collapsed, things looked dicey in terms of keeping Americans all frothed up about foreign adversaries. Sure, 9/11 helped, but what we really craved was a rationale for endless war. In Iraq, we implemented our playbook for the post-Vietnam, post-Soviet, 21st-century invasion, and  it’s amazing to see how well it all played out. Today, all we have to do is say “democracy,” and our political and media elite will rush to support any military action like slobbering dogs. I don’t mean to be immodest, but that’s exactly how I predicted it would go down.Any Iraq War reflection must contend with the rise of ISIS—one of America’s greatest accomplishments. ISIS was a real home run for us. We suspected that sowing wanton violence across the Middle East would stoke anti-American insurgencies that didn’t conform to conventional national or geographic boundaries. In theory, they could be everywhere. And if the enemy could be everywhere, it justified basically any action to stop them. Which was great, because the deliberately vague war on terror gave a blank check to the men and women who bravely reap the profits of our private military contractors.I imagine the name Halliburton rings a bell? What we wanted to do, what Rumsfeld and Condi and I and the rest of that bunch really wanted to do, was forever shift war-making into the hands of weapons contractors and mercenary armies. Not only does that make me and a bunch of my buddies incredibly rich, but it makes it so that even if regular people wanted to stop the war machine, they couldn’t. All decisions are made outside public control, and there aren’t any democratic mechanisms left to stop it. Of all the legacies of the war, that might be my absolute favorite.AdvertisementI’m calling on all Americans to support our mission to invade Thailand and restore democracy.Gotcha! You started feeling all patriotic for a second there, didn’t you? Started getting all indignant about those poor suffering Thai people and ready to put their flag in your social media handle? I have no fucking clue if Thailand has a democracy, and I don’t care. But inspiring that knee-jerk jingoistic reaction in you, that right there is the legacy of the Iraq War. That’s my legacy.When I’m right, I’m right.Because ultimately, that might be the thing we were most right about: We figured that tying being a “real American” to patriotism would make it effectively impossible to mount a serious anti-war effort in this country ever again. Since the Iraq War, Democrats have been so worried about being labeled soft on terrorism that they’ve given full-throated support to every military action that our weapons lobbyists and intelligence agencies could devise. In addition, legitimate public grievances over America’s most heinous actions can be reduced by the media to feckless “culture war” battles, which neutralizes their power. If you don’t believe those were major driving forces behind the war in Iraq, I have a weapon of mass destruction to sell you. AdvertisementIt’s easy for armchair critics to condemn the Iraq War. But you have to remember what things were like back in 2003. People actually trusted the government and had faith in the idea of America. Trust and faith aren’t very sturdy things to build a perpetual war machine on, and they don’t make a lot of money, either. The Iraq War eroded faith in the government and drove more Americans into suspicion and hatred, just as we hoped it would. Combine that with rising inequality and the American cult of the individual, and you have a perfect recipe for ensuring that most Americans are too disillusioned to mount collective resistance to any governmental transgressions. That’s what I always hoped the Iraq War might accomplish, and man, it feels good to be right. Looking back, it’s safe to say the Iraq War was the high point of my career. Except maybe shooting that guy.",1

"PHOENIX—In an effort to investigate claims that they were conspiring to suppress the market for the Baltimore Ravens quarterback, NFL owners announced Friday that they had held a secret meeting to make sure they weren’t colluding against Lamar Jackson.“We had a big clandestine gathering where all 32 of us completely agreed that there’s no collusion, so there you have it,” said Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, clarifying that owners were quite concerned after hearing rumors that they illegally collaborated to prevent any team from offering a large, guaranteed contract to Jackson, on whom the Baltimore Ravens placed a nonexclusive franchise tag in early March. “This is a group of 32 guys who are very above board and do everything by the book, in our businesses as well as in our team ownership, so we were deeply saddened by the suggestion that we might be up to something nefarious. We could hardly get through 18 holes of golf together, we were so shocked. But we decided that the only way to nip this thing in the bud was to hold a secret meeting closed to the press and hash it out. At this meeting, we came to the unanimous conclusion that it’s laughable to think we’d collude against Jackson, or any player, just to save ourselves money by preventing former league MVPs from receiving large contracts from quarterback-needy teams.

"LOS ANGELES—Following his return to the court after missing 13 games due to a torn tendon in his right foot, Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James told reporters Thursday he credited his quick injury recovery  to a crazed German doctor harnessing the power of lightning atop a mountain peak. “I feel good, I feel ready to play, but all credit goes to Dr. von Eberhöfer and his terrific team administering electrostatic discharges at the Institut Atmosphärische Auferstehung on the jagged cliffs of Mount Hochwanner,” said the 19-time All-Star, who, after team physicians recommended season-ending surgery, sought another opinion and ultimately engaged the services of an unkempt, raving German doctor who sheared off his toes in a geomagnetic storm, replacing them with those of a cadaver in a surgical procedure that lasted three days. “Getting hurt is tough, and the last thing you want is to sit out the rest of the season, so I’m really glad Dr. von Eberhöfer was able to reorient Earth’s magnetic field on the night of a full moon and repair my damaged tendon with tissue from a recently deceased centaur. Fortunately, I was able to really dedicate myself and get through rehab  once I took that potion the mad doctor whipped up in the astral laboratory deep within his lair. I’m just glad to be back with my teammates, who know I’ll agree to whatever Faustian bargains are necessary to return to the court. The doctor is also working with me on increasing my stamina by implanting a second heart in my chest.” In the Lakers’ front office, concerns about the four-time league MVP working with the mad Dr. von Eberhöfer reportedly rose following a team practice during which James’ lightning-repaired foot gained sentience and strangled Anthony Davis.WatchFBI Investigating Fourth-Grade Kid Who Said He Has Seen Over 200 Dead Bodies

"MARBLEHEAD, MA—Amid growing concerns about the sport’s potential effects on child brain development, local parents Jim and Angela Garza told reporters Friday that they were waiting to see their son’s test scores before prohibiting him from playing football. “We’re certainly concerned about what concussions and other injuries can do to a young body, but we don’t want to tell Isaac no if it turns out he flubs his standardized tests,” said Jim Garza, adding that he and his wife were only even entertaining the idea of their 8-year-old playing football after he asked them why he was having so much trouble reading at school. “Is football dangerous? That may be, but for some kids, like Isaac if he gets lower than the 65th percentile or so, that might be the best option. As parents, we have to remind ourselves that even if we don’t especially want our kid to do something, we’ve also tried to help him with his math homework, and if things keep going like this, we’re going to have to let him make his own decisions.” At press time, the Garzas were reportedly looking over their third-grader’s report card and telling him to give them the Pop Warner sign-up sheet.WatchFBI Investigating Fourth-Grade Kid Who Said He Has Seen Over 200 Dead Bodies

"NEW YORK—Explaining that the matter could at long last be put to rest, the nation’s major news outlets announced Thursday that this week’s indictment of the former president would finally close the chapter on media coverage of Donald Trump. “Now that he’s been indicted, Mr. Trump can’t possibly have any future in American public life, so we’ve decided to wrap things up,” said CNN CEO Chris Licht, noting that Trump would soon be arraigned in a Manhattan court on more than 30 charges of fraud, a development that seemed to represent the final nail in the coffin for entire news cycles centered around a man who has been out of office more than two years. “We followed the thread as long as we could, from the free publicity we provided him with during his first run for president to the shock we feigned when he attempted to overthrow an election. But after eight years of nonstop coverage, we feel it would be irresponsible of us as journalists to continue our exhaustive reporting on a story that has clearly reached an end.” Licht added that CNN would now pivot to issues of greater news value, like the cheating scandal on Vanderpump Rules.

"PALM BEACH, FL—Responding to the news that the Manhattan District Attorney had indicted him over payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, former President Donald Trump denounced the move  Friday, telling reporters, “All arrests are politically motivated, as the legal system is the codified exercise of political power.” “This indictment is obviously an attempt by the Democrats to use against me the complex webs of power relations that influence the nature of rights and consequences in a given society and that we conceptualize as a legal system,” Trump said before quoting verbatim a passage from political philosopher Michel Foucault that reads, “The judges of normality are present everywhere. We are in the society of the teacher-judge, the doctor-judge, the educator-judge, the ‘social-worker’-judge; it is on them that the universal reign of the normative is based.” “This is nothing more than a political witch hunt carried out by corrupt Democratic officials using the law as a political cudgel, as it intrinsically is, because what is the law but a system by which the powerful may enforce adherence to certain rules and strictures among the less powerful? These Soros-backed Manhattanites are using the United States legal system as clarified in the landmark 1803 case Marbury v. Madison—which established the Constitution, and therefore America’s legal system, as not merely a set of principles but as the actual law of the land—to target me for what they claim is a violation of those laws. Yet I remind them that until now no American president has ever been indicted, which is as clear an example of the politically charged nature of the law as I can think of. Legal positivism, as understood by Jeremy Bentham and others, tells us that there is not necessarily a connection between morality and the law, and so it follows that a so-called lawbreaking act that may be considered punishable in some cases is left unpunished in others. Is that discrepancy not, then, a question of political power? For even such an act as taking another human life is deemed effectively above the law in some cases, if we are to follow the Schmittian logic of the sovereign state of exception. What these partisan hacks need to get through their thick skulls is that political concerns are permitted, by general agreement, or at least by the threat of state violence standing in for democratic accord, to make legal structures and consequences selectively applicable. But this is just another example of big-city legal departments wielding the law for political aims. I mean, seriously, just look at how the law is selectively enforced on the Black populations of U.S. cities, with arrest and incarceration rates far outstripping those of whites. The critical race theories of Derrick Bell, Kimberlé  Williams Crenshaw, and others are instructive on this point, positing that legal progress for Black people only occurs when it converges with the political interests of the white elite. Of course, I’d expect nothing less from a sad, declining country where political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” At press time, numerous Republican officials, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, Rep. Matt Gaetz, and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, had come out in agreement that Trump’s arrest was politically motivated by tweeting passages on legal relativism from The Common Law by the late Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.WatchInspiring Woman Becomes Professional Surfer Despite Shark Biting Head Off

Then, once I graduate, I’ll be able to practice dental hygiene anywhere! If it gets to be too much, I can always cut back my course load and do half-time enrollment, which would still land me in a good job by the time I’m 102. And who knows, if I end up liking it enough, I may apply to dental school.” Carter went on to add that, while the program doesn’t begin until the fall, he’d already excitedly purchased a few pairs of novelty scrubs.WatchFBI Investigating Fourth-Grade Kid Who Said He Has Seen Over 200 Dead Bodies

"NEW YORK—In a dramatic twist that shocked viewers who had waited more than a year for a new episode of the HBO drama, Sunday’s season premiere of Succession featured an unexpected reappearance of the show’s shadowy Dr. Succession character. “Longtime fans of the series were appalled and delighted when its powerful but seldom-seen antagonist, the nefarious Dr. Succession, stepped out of the darkness in the warehouse to which he had lured the Roy family and let out one of his trademark cackles,” said TV critic Emily Barnes, who argued that the eponymous villain’s return had been subtly foreshadowed ever since Siobhan Roy pushed him into a volcano at the end of season two, leading her family to believe he had finally been vanquished. “The reemergence of the menacing psychologist and inventor who swore to wreak terrible vengeance on the Roys after their media empire inadvertently killed his wife is a welcome development for the new season. From the moment Dr. Succession revealed that he was Logan Roy’s evil twin brother as they did battle in their mech suits atop Waystar Royco headquarters, viewers have appreciated the Shakespearean dimensions of this nuanced character. In the early seasons, audiences tuned into Succession to see if the Roys could put aside their differences and harness the power of love to stop Dr. Succession when he strapped a bomb to the president of the United States or turned back time, causing Manhattan to be overrun with dinosaurs. One can only hope the show’s final season is a return to form in which Kendall, Shiv, Roman, and the rest of the crew face off against this chilling puppet master who seeks to rule the world with a bionic fist.” In a sneak peak of the season’s second episode, Dr. Succession is seen laughing hysterically as he tells the Roy family, “Now, my friends, it is you who will fuck off!” WatchEPA Closes Down After Running Out Of Salvageable Environment To Protect

"HUTCHINSON, KS—In what a judge overseeing the case said he hoped would be a precedent, Hutchinson Correctional Facility prisoner Brett Dailey was given an extra 10 years in prison for good behavior Tuesday so he could serve as a role model for his fellow inmates. “Mr. Dailey has been an exemplary inmate from the first day he arrived here, and we just can’t let someone like that go,” Judge Erick Hastings wrote in the ruling, adding that society could ill afford to have someone as thoughtful and good at problem-solving as Dailey walking the streets when he had so much he could still teach to other incarcerated men. “We’ve seen phenomenal progress from Mr. Dailey during his long stint at the facility library, and he is unfailingly positive in his interactions with other inmates, often serving as a peacemaker in solving long-standing conflicts. Due to his good behavior, Mr. Dailey will be paired with our most hardened and angry inmates over the next several years in hopes that he’ll rub off on them. The state simply cannot grant parole to an inmate of his caliber. Who knows what kind of violent hell this place might descend into without him. We will review Mr. Dailey’s sentencing terms again in 2033, although if he’s still behaving this well, it’s highly unlikely we’d let him go.” Those who know the prisoner say they aren’t surprised at his good behavior, nothing that several months ago he had been completely exonerated of the crime he’d been imprisoned for.WatchFBI Investigating Fourth-Grade Kid Who Said He Has Seen Over 200 Dead Bodies

Around 260 people were in the Apollo Theater, Belvidere, when the roof caved in at 19:55 local time (01:05 BST), the local fire department said. Fire chief Shawn Schadle said that five people were in a serious condition. A series of fierce tornadoes ripped through several US states on Friday, killing at least 11 people in total. As well as in Illinois, deaths have also been reported in Arkansas, Alabama, Indiana and Mississippi. In Arkansas' state capital Little Rock, a major tornado tore through the city, flipping cars, smashing roofs and toppling trees. Extensive damage was also reported in parts of the South and Midwest - with the states of Arkansas and Missouri declaring states of emergency. Tens of thousands were left without power. More than 40 tornado reports were made across seven states on Friday night, according to the US government's Storm Prediction Center. Several flights at Chicago O'Hare International Airport were delayed or cancelled as passengers were told to take shelter due to what it described as ""severe weather"". In Tennessee, Covington Mayor Jan Hensley pleaded with people not to ""drive around"" as power lines had been hit by storms. The Covington Police Department described the city as ""impassable"" sharing photos of roads blocked by downed power poles and large trees toppled in front of homes. Mrs Huckabee Sanders deployed the National Guard after what she described as ""significant damage"" in central Arkansas. As of 20:30 local time, more than 70,000 in her state were without electricity, according to the US power outage website. Friday's night of deadly tornadoes comes just one week after a rare, long-track twister killed 26 people in Mississippi. President Joe Biden visited the state on Friday to pay his condolences and promise federal aid. In a bulletin the Storm Prediction Center warned some of the projected tornadoes could track across the ground for long distances. The Mississippi tornado last week travelled 59 miles (94km) and lasted about an hour and 10 minutes - an unusually long period of time for a storm to sustain itself. It damaged about 2,000 homes, officials said. Additional reporting by Tiffany Wertheimer.",0
"This video can not be played Watch: Man pours yoghurt over unveiled women in Iran shop Two women have been arrested in Iran after being attacked with yoghurt, seemingly for not covering their hair in public. In the video, which went viral, two female customers are approached by the man, who begins talking to them. He then takes what appears to be a bucket of yoghurt from a shelf and angrily throws it over their heads. Iran's judiciary said the two women have been detained for showing their hair, which is illegal in Iran. The man has also been arrested for disturbing the public order, it added. The arrests follow months of protests in the country demanding an end to the compulsory wearing of the hijab (headscarf). The footage shows the women in the shop, waiting to be served by a member of staff. A man who looks to be passing by then walks in to confront them. After he speaks, he repeatedly attacks them with yoghurt. The attacker is then pushed out of the shop by the shopkeeper. Arrest warrants were issued and the three were subsequently arrested, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported. It added that ""necessary notices"" have been issued to the owner of the shop to ensure compliance with the law. Not wearing the hijab in public is illegal for women in Iran, however in big cities, many walk around without it despite the rules. Anger and frustration with the law have driven dissent in Iranian society. Protests spread across the Islamic Republic in September following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab ""improperly"". The protests widened, but they remained rooted in the issue of the hijab. Thousands have been arrested and four protesters have been executed since December. But the authorities show no sign of relenting. One hardline Iranian MP, Hossein Ali Haji Deligani, has issued an ultimatum to the judiciary to come up with measures to put a stop to the flouting of the rules within the next 48 hours. And on Saturday, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi reiterated that Iranian women should wear the hijab as a ""religious necessity"". ""Hijab is a legal matter and adherence to it is obligatory,"" he said in quotes cited by AFP news agency.

The other permanent members of the council are the UK, US, France, and China. The role is mostly procedural, but Moscow's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzia, told the Russian Tass news agency that he planned to oversee several debates, including one on arms control. He said he would discuss a ""new world order"" that, he said, was coming to ""replace the unipolar one"". Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called Russia's presidency ""the worst joke ever for April Fool's Day"" and a ""stark reminder that something is wrong with the way international security architecture is functioning"". And in a further comment on Saturday, he called it ""a slap in the face to the international community"". Ukraine's presidential adviser, Mykhaylo Podolyak, said the move was ""another rape of international law... an entity that wages an aggressive war, violates the norms of humanitarian and criminal law, destroys the UN Charter, neglects nuclear safety, can't head the world's key security body"". President Volodymyr Zelensky called last year for the Security Council to reform or ""dissolve altogether"", accusing it of failing to take enough action to prevent Russia's invasion. He has also called for Russia to be removed of its member status. But the US has said its hands were tied as the UN charter does not allow for the removal of a permanent member. ""Unfortunately, Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council and no feasible international legal pathway exists to change that reality,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told a news briefing this week. She added the US expects Moscow ""to continue to use its seat on the council to spread disinformation"" and justify its actions in Ukraine. The UN Security Council is an international body responsible for maintaining peace. Five nations are permanently represented on the Security Council. They reflect the post-war power structure that held sway when the council was formed. Members of this group work alongside 10 non-permanent member countries. Russia's presence as a permanent member on the Security Council means it can veto resolutions. To pass a Security Council vote, there must be nine votes in favour, with none of the five permanent members voting against. In February last year Russia vetoed a resolution that intended to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine (China, India and the United Arab Emirates all abstained). In September it vetoed a resolution calling for the reversal of its illegal annexation of four regions of Ukraine. Brazil, China, Gabon and India abstained.

"Pope Francis has joked that he is ""still alive"" as he left hospital in Rome after a three-day stay. He was admitted to Gemelli Hospital mid-week with breathing difficulties, and later diagnosed with bronchitis. The Vatican had said he was responding to antibiotics and would be released on Saturday, depending on test results. ""I wasn't frightened, I'm still alive,"" the 86-year-old pontiff told reporters and tearful well wishers outside the hospital before being driven away. He was seen smiling and waving from the car, before getting out to speak to a crowd. He then headed for the Vatican. The Pope's admission to hospital came ahead of the busiest week in the Christian calendar to mark Easter. Holy Week, as it is known, includes a busy schedule of events and services that can be physically demanding. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said on Friday that the Pope was expected to take part in this weekend's service for Palm Sunday. ""I can confirm that, since he is scheduled to leave the hospital tomorrow [Saturday], Pope Francis is expected to be present in St Peter's Square on Sunday for the Eucharistic celebration of Palm Sunday, the Passion of the Lord,"" Bruni said in a statement. He added the Pope would return to Santa Marta, the papal residence within the Vatican, once he had left hospital. The Argentine pontiff, who marked 10 years as head of the Catholic Church earlier this month, has suffered a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21. He has also used a wheelchair in recent months because of problems related to his knee. But the Pope has remained active, visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan in February.

"Authorities say they have recovered the bodies of eight migrants, including two children, who died trying to cross illegally from Canada into the US. A police helicopter spotted two more bodies in the St Lawrence River on Friday. Two families from Romania and India are among the dead. Officials at the time were searching for a missing boater in the area, Casey Oakes, 30. He is still missing. It is unclear if there is any link between Mr Oakes and the families. Police said the first body was found around 17:00 local time (21:00 GMT) in a marsh in Tsi Snaihne in Akwesasne, a Mohawk territory right between the US-Canada border. The other bodies were discovered nearby. Their identities have not yet been released by police. The dead were six adults and two children. One child was under the age of three and had a Canadian passport. The other infant was also a Canadian citizen, a local police chief told reporters at a Friday news conference. The bodies are believed to be from two families, one of Romanian descent and one of Indian descent, Lee-Ann O'Brien, deputy chief of Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service, told reporters. ""All are believed to have been attempting illegal entry into the US from Canada,"" Ms O'Brien said. She added that weather conditions were rough in the area on Wednesday night. The bodies were found in the Quebec area of Akwesasne, a Mohawk community whose territory includes parts of Ontario, Quebec and New York State. It is located about 120km west of Montreal. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: ""This is a heartbreaking situation. ""We need to understand properly what happened, how it happened and do whatever we can to minimize the chances of this ever happening again."" Bodies of people attempting to cross into the US from Canada have been discovered at other locations in recent months. In January, police in Canada found the bodies of four people, including an infant, in a snow field near Emerson, Manitoba, by the US-Canada border. The dead are believed to be a family from India, US officials said. A Montreal man was also found dead near the US-Canada border in December. Fritznel Richard, 44, was trying to cross into the US to reunite with his wife and child. US border agents have noted an uptick of people crossing back from Canada. In January, US Border Patrol apprehended 367 people attempting to cross north to south - more than the number of such crossings in the last 12 years combined.",0

"This video can not be played WATCH: Scientists film a species of snailfish swimming at an extraordinary depth, seen here in the first 15 seconds (later fish are at a slightly shallower depth) Scientists have filmed a fish swimming at an extraordinary depth in the ocean, making it the deepest observation of this nature that has ever been made. The species - a type of snailfish of the genus Pseudoliparis - was filmed swimming at 8,336m (27,349ft). It was filmed by an autonomous ""lander"" dropped into the Izu-Ogasawara Trench, south of Japan. The lead scientist said the snailfish could be at, or very close to, the maximum depth any fish can survive. The previous deepest fish observation was made at 8,178m, further south in the Pacific in the Mariana Trench. This discovery therefore beats the depth record by 158m. ""If this record is broken, it would only be by minute increments, potentially by just a few meters,"" Prof Alan Jamieson told BBC News. The University of Western Australia deep-sea scientist made a prediction 10 years ago that fish would likely be found as deep as 8,200m to 8,400m. A decade of investigations around the globe has confirmed this. The juvenile Pseudoliparis was filmed by a camera system attached to a weighted frame released from over the side of a ship, the DSSV Pressure Drop. Bait was added to the frame to attract sea life. Although a specimen was not caught to fully identify its species type, several fish were trapped slightly higher up in the water column in the nearby Japan Trench at a depth of 8,022m. These, again, were snailfish, Pseudoliparis belyaevi, and set a record for the deepest fish ever caught. Snailfish are truly remarkable. There are over 300 species, most of which are actually shallow-water creatures and can be found in river estuaries. But the snailfish group have also adapted to life in the cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic, and also under the extreme pressure conditions that exist in the world's deepest trenches. At 8km down, they are experiencing more than 80 megapascals, or 800 times the pressure at the ocean surface. Their gelatinous bodies help them survive. Not having a swim bladder, the gas-filled organ to control buoyancy that is found in many other fish, is an additional advantage. Likewise, their approach to food - they are suction feeders and consume tiny crustaceans, of which there are many in trenches. Prof Jamieson says the discovery of a fish deeper than those found in the Mariana Trench is probably due to the Izu-Ogasawara's slightly warmer waters. ""We predicted the deepest fish would be there and we predicted it would be a snailfish,"" he said. ""I get frustrated when people tell me we know nothing about the deep sea. We do. Things are changing really fast."" Prof Jamieson is the founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre. On this expedition, which also explored the Ryukyu Trenche, he worked with a team from the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology. The DSSV Pressure Drop and its crew-capable submarine, Limiting Factor, were used by the American adventurer Victor Vescovo in 2018 and 2019 to visit the deepest parts of Earth's five major oceans. The Texan became the first person in history to complete the quintet of dives, and Prof Jamieson acted as his chief scientist. The ship and the submarine were sold last year to the marine research organisation Inkfish and sent for a refit in San Diego. They have also been renamed - the ship is now Dagon and the submarine is Bakunawa - and will head back out to sea again in June with Prof Jamieson again acting as the chief scientist. Prof Jamieson, who was born in Scotland, is credited with discovering not just the deepest fish in our oceans but also the deepest octopus,  jellyfish and squid.",0
"Authorities say seven US health investigators fell ill while probing the impact of the 3 February train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the investigator's symptoms included nausea and headaches. Locals in East Palestine have reported similar illnesses. The train was carrying vinyl chloride and other potentially hazardous substances. The CDC investigators formed part of a team that was conducting house-to-house interviews in the area of the derailment last month, according to authorities. They immediately reported their symptoms to federal authorities after they fell ill. ""Symptoms resolved for most team members later the same afternoon,"" the CDC said in a statement. ""Everyone resumed work on survey data collection within 24 hours. Impacted team members have not reported ongoing health effects."" In the wake of the derailment, state and federal officials repeatedly sought to reassure East Palestine residents that local air and water supplies were safe. Residents, however, reported headaches, nausea, burning eyes and sore throats, sparking fears that their long-term health could be impacted. Environmental officials have said that nearly 45,000 animals died as a result of the toxic train crash, although all were aquatic species. One of the chemicals that the train was carrying, vinyl chloride, is a colourless, hazardous gas that is primarily used to make PVC plastic. It is also a known carcinogen and acute exposure is linked to dizziness, drowsiness and headaches. Prolonged exposure can cause liver damage and a rare form of liver cancer. On Thursday, the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the company that operated the train - Norfolk Southern - over environmental damage caused by the derailment. The justice department said it plans to hold the company responsible for ""unlawfully polluting the nation's waterways and to ensure it pays the full cost of the environmental cleanup,"" the lawsuit states. Additionally, the lawsuit is seeking fines and a judgement that will hold the firm accountable for future costs associated with the environmental response to the derailment. A separate lawsuit, filed by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost last month, is seeking to recoup the state's costs and ensure that Norfolk Southern carries out long-term environmental monitoring. Norfolk Southern has repeatedly apologised for the crash and has so far pledged $27.9m (£22.6m) to the community. ""I am deeply sorry for the impact this derailment has had on the people of East Palestine and surrounding communities,"" CEO Alan Shaw told a Senate committee earlier this month. ""I am determined to make this right.""",0

"The oldest killer whale in captivity may soon be returned to her home waters in the Pacific Northwest, more than 50 years after her capture. Lolita, a 56-year-old orca, was the star attraction at the Miami Seaquarium in Florida for decades. Animal welfare activists have spent years lobbying for her release. On Thursday, the aquarium announced it will begin the process of returning the orca to her natural habitat in the next two years. The Miami Seaquarium is partnering with the non-profit Friends of Lolita to send the whale back across the country. Footing the bill for Lolita's relocation will be Jim Irsay, owner of NFL football team the Indianapolis Colts. ""I'm excited about being part of Lolita's journey,"" Mr Irsay said. ""She is one tough creature. It's amazing. Ever since I was a little kid, I loved whales."" Lolita, also known by her original name Tokitae or Toki, is a female Southern Resident killer whale. These orcas live exclusively in the North Pacific Ocean and spend several months of the year in Washington State's Puget Sound, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This special population of orcas were deemed an endangered species in 2005, due in part to captivity programmes that hunted the animals throughout the 1970s, when Lolita was captured. In his book documenting the history of the global fascination with killer whales, Jason Colby, an environmental historian and professor at the University of Victoria, describes how Lolita was captured in August 1970. At the time, captors would partner with local fisherman to heard young orca calves into nets, separate them from their pods, and ultimately sell them to amusement parks like Seaworld and Miami Seaquarium. ""When Lolita is captured, the captors accidentally end up rounding up nearly the entire population of Southern Resident (killer whales),"" he told the BBC. ""There was about 90 orcas behind their nets at one point."" Mr Colby says that animal rights activists tried to free the whales by cutting the fishermen's nets, but some whales became entangled and four calves drowned. Eight orcas, including Lolita, were captured. ""This was in August 1970 - the Vietnam War was going on. It was the first term of Richard Nixon's presidency - that's how long she's been in captivity,"" he said. Lolita was sold to the Miami Seaquarium where she would perform alongside another Southern Resident whale named Hugo, according to the park's website. He died in 1980, so she has not had another orca whale to socialise with for over 40 years. Once released, she will be the oldest orca to be flown to a new habitat, Mr Colby said. In the more than 50 years since then, she has been living in an 80ft by 35ft (26m by 11m) tank at the Seaquarium, a space critics say is dangerously small for an animal that is roughly 20ft (6m) long. One critic of the tank's size was the daughter of Eduardo Albor, CEO of The Dolphin Company, the largest amusement park owner in Latin America. Mr Albor visited the theme park with her shortly before acquiring the Miami Seaquarium in 2021. ""She told me, if we ever take management of this place, you promise me you will see how to improve this,"" he said. The next year, the Seaquarium announced Lolita's retirement from the stage after 52 years of performing. Mr Albor praised animal rights activists and the Seaquarium team for putting aside differences and working together. ""We have the same goal and now the world will see, amazing things are possible when we listen and work together,"" he said. But experts caution that relocating Lolita will have major hurdles. ""I fear that when people see that she's being brought home, people will imagine it's just going to be a sort of Free Willy moment where she swims over and connects with her family. I can't imagine that happening,"" said Mr Colby, the environmental historian. Lolita's age and the fact that she's lived in captivity for decades and is unable to forage on her own could complicate her release back into the wild, Mr Colby said. Instead of releasing Lolita back into the Salish Sea to live in the wild, Mr Colby said the orca will likely live out her remaining days in a sea pen that will allow her to feel her 'home waters' and reconnect acoustically with the pod she was separated from decades ago. That, he said, would still be a powerful, symbolic victory. ""If her coming back makes people commit to making sure that this orca family has a healthy place to live then it will be a great success,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Watch: The moment Andrew Tate and his brother released from custody Controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have been moved from custody to house arrest following a ruling by a Romanian judge. The ruling by the Court of Appeal in Bucharest replaces the latest period of custody, which was to end on 29 April. Two associates, Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu, are also being released. All four have been ordered to stay in the buildings where they live, unless they have judicial permission to leave. A spokeswoman for the Tate brothers told the BBC the brothers were ""ecstatic"". After being released, Andrew posted a video of himself pacing in a room while smoking a cigar, saying: ""Since last year I've been in 24-hour lockdown. No yard time. ""Pacing a 3-metre cell with zero electronics or outside contact. Absolute clarity of mind. Real thoughts. Real plans. Vivid pain. One hour home and I can't stand my phone. ""Some habits die hard. We must defeat Shaytan."" Tristan, meanwhile, tweeted: ""4 months without putting on a pair of alligator shoes. The struggle was real."" The brothers have been detained since December. They are being investigated on allegations of rape, people trafficking and forming an organised crime group. Both have denied wrongdoing. Lawyers for the Tates argued that keeping them in preventative custody was unnecessarily harsh, when other judicial options such as house arrest were available. Leaked court documents, seen by the BBC, outlined testimony from alleged victims claiming to be forced to earn €10,000 (£8,800) a month on social media platforms, under the alleged threat of physical violence. Court papers also described debts being used as ""a form of psychological coercion"". Since investigations began last April, six women have been identified by prosecutors as victims. However, no charges have been brought against the brothers or the two Romanian associates who were arrested alongside them. In 2016, Andrew Tate, a British-American former kickboxer, was removed from British TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to show him attacking a woman. He went on to gain notoriety online, with Twitter banning him for saying women should ""bear responsibility"" for being sexually assaulted. He has since been reinstated. Despite social media bans, he gained popularity, particularly among young men, by promoting what he presented as a hyper-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle.",0
"Ukrainian investigators have searched the home of an Orthodox Church leader in Kyiv accused of justifying Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine. Metropolitan Pavel Lebed runs the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, Ukraine's most important monastery. His branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was previously loyal to Moscow clergy. Kyiv prosecutors say he is suspected of inciting national and religious hatred. Kyiv has been trying to evict him and his followers from the monastery. Metropolitan Pavel has denied the allegations and argues that the Kyiv authorities have no legal grounds for evicting the monks and staff from the monastery. In a court appearance on Saturday he called it ""a political case"" and said ""I've never been on the side of aggression"" - though he did not mention Russia. ""I'm against aggression. And now I'm in Ukraine - this is my land,"" he said. He described his current status as ""house arrest"". On Friday hundreds of worshippers gathered at the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra monastery - famous for its historic caves - in support of the monks there, protesting against the eviction order. A statement from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), on the Telegram messaging service, says Metropolitan Pavel is suspected of ""violating citizens' equality"" based on their racial, national and religious ties. It says he ""repeatedly insulted the religious feelings of Ukrainians"", ""humiliated"" other faith groups and ""tried to create hostile attitudes towards them"". ""He also made statements that justified or denied the actions of the aggressor state,"" the SBU says. It has posted recordings on YouTube which it alleges are phone intercepts of Metropolitan Pavel. In one, a male voice believed to be his, describes Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a ""war between the Russian Federation and America until the last Ukrainian is killed"", claiming it was Ukraine that provoked Russian aggression. Speaking about the Russian occupation of Kherson last year - before Ukrainian forces retook the city - he says ""there are already Russian flags everywhere and people are happy"". Commenting on Saturday's move against the abbot, SBU head Vasyl Malyuk said ""today the enemy is trying to use the church environment to promote its propaganda and divide Ukrainian society"". ""But we will not give him a single chance!"" he stressed. Last year, the SBU raided the Lavra and other buildings belonging to the UOC, and it says 61 Orthodox clerics have been prosecuted for pro-Russian activities. Courts convicted seven, including two clerics who were exchanged in prisoner swaps with Russia. The UOC says there is no evidence to support the charges of collaboration. In recent years many worshippers have joined the independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine. But millions still follow the UOC, which split from Moscow last May after centuries under its control. The Russian Orthodox Church has allied itself with President Vladimir Putin, echoing Kremlin rhetoric in defending the invasion of Ukraine.",0
"Former US President Donald Trump is being charged with a crime in relation to a payment he made to a porn star. The man who spent four years in the White House is now days away from being fingerprinted, given a mugshot photo and brought before a judge. This is happening as he campaigns to become president again, in the 2024 election. Here is what the case is about. It emerged on Thursday night that a jury in New York has voted to indict Mr Trump, which means they believe there is enough evidence to bring criminal charges against him. We don't yet know what those charges are. But for weeks the jury has been hearing evidence about a payment made to buy the silence of a porn star called Stormy Daniels. It happened before Mr Trump was president, just before the 2016 election which he won against Hillary Clinton. We will find out exactly what the charges are on Tuesday when the 76-year-old is arrested and appears before a judge in Manhattan. Stormy Daniels says she had an affair with Mr Trump in 2006, which he has always denied. In 2016 she tried to sell her account of what happened to the media. Mr Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid her $130,000 (£105,000) to keep quiet. That kind of payment is called hush money. That is not illegal but what has got Mr Trump into trouble is how Mr Cohen's reimbursement was recorded in his accounts. He is accused of falsifying his business records by saying the payment was for legal fees. As it happened just before Americans were due to vote, it may also violate laws about payments that help an election campaign. There will now be a trial where Mr Trump will make his case. He has denied any wrongdoing and says the charges are politically motivated. The most likely outcome is a fine but there is also a chance he could be sent to prison. If any of the charges are serious - what in the US is called a felony - then Mr Trump would face a maximum of four years in prison. But legal experts tell the BBC that time behind bars is unlikely. Yes, there's nothing in the US constitution to prevent Mr Trump from continuing his election campaign now he is being charged. Even if he was imprisoned, he could theoretically still run for president and win an election. But there are practical considerations. A prolonged legal fight and a trial will be a major diversion from a presidential campaign - in time and energy, and the scheduling of election rallies. Yes. He faced two major inquiries by Congress when he was president, called impeachments, but was acquitted by the US Senate both times. Now he has left office he can no longer be impeached but instead can be indicted and faces a number of criminal investigations. They are continuing and we will hear more about them in the months ahead.",0
"The historic criminal indictment against former US President Donald Trump has sparked another partisan flashpoint in an already deeply polarised nation. Ahead of his court appearance next Tuesday, voters have been sharing with the BBC their strongly felt reactions to the first prosecution of a former president. Whatever their political affiliation, most of our voter panel agreed that the unprecedented case leaves the US in uncharted waters. This is an excellent example of the politicisation of the judiciary. It's a huge mistake. Banana republic style vindictiveness. It's, in my opinion, totally undermining our rule of law and sets the US up for real trouble ahead. It's a huge mess and completely destructive. This action taken by the New York district attorney destroys any respect for the rule of law that many in the public had. It does not inspire trust or confidence in our system. It is very worrisome. Again, can't stress it enough - it's a huge mistake and the ramifications are going to be deep and far reaching. I worry for the times ahead in our country. We're heading into turbulent times and our institutions and customs will be tested like we've never seen before. I hope our republic can survive - all because of a vindictive and petty, hypocritical step by a 'smallish' prosecutor in New York. This is one of many things that he should be charged with, and more presidents should be charged with more wrongdoing than just Trump. I think that denying prosecution of a public or political figure is itself an inherently political move. Presidents should absolutely be held to the same - or higher standards - of public scrutiny and lawful consequences. He should absolutely face prosecution. I genuinely think that the battle lines in the country have already been drawn. I think that people have made up their minds about Trump. They love him or hate him and I don't see that changing. I feel they want to put a 'stain' on Donald Trump's  character - as no other president has been criminally charged in our US history. I am surprised that they actually indicted him. This looks very bad for our country and for Trump to run in 2024. The news will focus on this more than anything that Trump has accomplished, and it will have a negative impact on Trump's run for 2024. I'm saddened to see this happen and do not agree with the Manhattan jury. I hope Trump can pick a good running mate - he is going to need it. These are indeed uncharted times we are embarking on. Living in the New York area, we are a bit on guard but overall I believe these growing pains are necessary for us as a country to affirm who we are - a country where no-one is above the law. It's hard to find a person who believes the former president didn't break laws, they simply debate whether he should be charged, which in itself says a lot about the vulnerability of our democracy right now. For me, it's a naked and blatantly gross breach of responsibility by the Manhattan district attorney that goes beyond anything I've ever witnessed in my life. It is an embarrassment that in this country, things have gotten to the point where an extreme stretch in interpretation of the law could be used in an attempt to take out a political opponent. This is the stuff of banana republics and countries that have been or are under the control of dictatorial power. Moreover, I think the Manhattan district attorney, with all that is on his plate with regards to crime in his jurisdiction, is so out of touch to want to go after a former president instead of focusing on the immediate needs of his electorate. I predict this will come back to haunt Biden in the 2024 election cycle that is just now getting underway - look for Republicans to pull all the stops going after the president and his son in their investigations. I'm glad that the law applies to everyone. I look forward to him having to answer for himself and let a jury decide. I'm comfortable letting the system do it's job. I'm also really sad that this day has come to the US. The fact that this took a long time to happen is good - this wasn't some rush to achieve a pre-defined objective. I'm also hoping Trump is healthy at least long enough to see this to its conclusion. I also think that if Trump could watch Michael Cohen get convicted for campaign finance crimes he committed for him, it will likely make it easier to prove that there was in fact a federal crime connected to the money. I'm sure Cohen will feel vindicated.",0
"Former President Donald Trump and porn star Stormy Daniels have spent years battling in court. Now, they're selling duelling T-shirts. A Manhattan grand jury voted on Thursday to indict Mr Trump in connection with a $130,000 (£105,000) hush money payment to Ms Daniels. She alleges the two had an affair in 2006. Mr Trump has acknowledged the pay-out but denied they had sex. His campaign sent a fundraising email soon after the charges were reported. ""This Witch Hunt will BACKFIRE MASSIVELY,"" he said in the email. ""With your support, we will write the next great chapter of American history - and 2024 will forever go down as the year we saved our Republic."" The message asked people for money, offering a T-shirt with the words ""I stand with Trump"" for donations of $47 (£38) or more, which his campaign team claimed were ""flying off shelves"". The Trump campaign says it raised more than $4m in the first 24 hours after news of the indictment broke. But the case has brought a windfall for Ms Daniels, too. In a tweet on Thursday after charges were announced, Ms Daniels - whose real name is Stephanie Clifford - said orders for ""#Teamstormy merch/authograph[s]"" were ""pouring in"". ""Thank you to everyone for your support and love!"" she wrote. Her website features a range of merchandise, including $20 T-shirts with the words ""#TEAMSTORMY"", signed posters of herself posing in lingerie, and a $30 dog chew toy that looks like Mr Trump. . Her tweet was liked more than 94,000 times, while dozens of users replied with thank-you messages. The porn star has over a million followers on Twitter, as well as a Facebook fan club page with more than 2,000 members, many of them ardent critics of Mr Trump. In a live stream on Wednesday night on OnlyFans, a subscription-based website known for its adult content, Ms Daniels defended herself from criticism that she was trying to profit off  the affair, according to the Independent. This video can not be played Witch hunt or justice? US split on Trump indictment ""Everybody that has a business sells merch,"" she said, pointing out Mr Trump was similarly using the case to pull in funds. ""That's actually - I can't believe I'm about to say this - kind of brilliant,"" she said. ""Why is it OK for him and it's not OK for me?"" But Ms Daniels and Mr Trump aren't the only ones cashing in. Outside the former president's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, on Friday, merchandise vendor Ronald Solomon told Reuters news agency that sales of Trump-themed hats and T-shirts had soared.

At Mr Trump's political rally in Texas last Saturday, the former president was already fixated on an arrest that seemed to be looming. ""This is really prosecutorial misconduct,"" Mr Trump said of the New York City district attorney's inquiry. ""The innocence of people makes no difference to these radical left maniacs."" As the news broke, other members of the Republican Party closed ranks around their former president. Several senior members of the House of Representatives called the indictment ""outrageous"" and pledged a thorough congressional investigation. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy said the New York district attorney had ""irreparably damaged"" the nation in an attempt to interfere with the 2024 presidential election. Several of Mr Trump's potential rivals for the Republic nomination condemned the charges. ""Prosecuting serious crimes keeps Americans safe, but political prosecutions put the American legal system at risk of being viewed as a tool for abuse,"" former Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, viewed as Mr Trump's most formidable potential opponent, was equally strident in a Twitter post, calling the indictment ""un-American"". ""The weaponisation of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head,"" he wrote. He added that Florida would not assist in an extradition of Mr Trump to New York to face the charges. Mr Trump's lawyers have previously said he would go to the courthouse willingly - something expected to happen early next week. At some point, however, Mr Trump's rivals will have to turn on him - and a lower-profile potential candidate may have given a hint of the strategy in his Thursday evening press release. ""It is a dark day for America when a former president is indicted on criminal charges,"" former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said, noticeably not calling the indictment unjust. Donald Trump has surged in Republican approval polls recently, but there is still sentiment that his drama - the political storm clouds that always seem to follow him - is a liability that will make him a less appealing presidential candidate. For that line of attack, this indictment could become Exhibit A, noted by his Republican opponents more with sadness than with glee. For its part, the Trump campaign is leaning into the controversy, using the front-page headlines and breaking news bulletins to drum up new donations from supporters. ""Please make a contribution - of truly any amount - to defend our movement from the never-ending witch hunts and WIN the WHITE HOUSE in 2024,"" read a campaign email that included Mr Trump's press release on the indictment. It promised that the indictment would ""backfire"" on President Joe Biden and the Democrats. At least so far, the White House has been keeping a studious silence on the matter - similar to the strategy it employed during Mr Trump's 2021 Senate impeachment trial after the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Their view, perhaps, aligns with the old Napoleon quote about not interrupting an enemy when they're making a mistake. Other Democrats, however, have been less reticent. ""The bedrock of our legal system is the principle that justice applies to everyone equally,"" Democratic Senator Cory Booker said in a statement. ""No-one is above the law."" The Democratic National Committee's press secretary tried to link Mr Trump and his legal troubles to the former president's ""Make America Great Again"" movement and the Republican Party as a whole. Democrats, and many political analysts, attribute the party's better-than-expected performance in last year's mid-term elections to Republican candidates being too closely associated with a former president who, while still loved by many Republicans, is disliked by a majority of Americans. Expect Democrats to once again employ a similar line of attack. Mr Trump's current legal drama may reach a crescendo and conclude well before a vote is cast in 2024. The political fallout could ultimately depend on the course it tracks - and whether this case is joined by others. For the moment, however, the partisan lines on Mr Trump's indictment are clearly drawn - as they have been on almost every major issue of national importance in America today.",0

"The BBC has launched a new education programme for children in Afghanistan who are banned from school. It is aimed at children aged 11 to 16, including girls whose secondary education has been stopped by the ruling Taliban. The weekly programme is called Dars, which means lesson in Dari and Pashto, Afghanistan's official languages. It is hosted by BBC Afghan female journalists who were evacuated from Kabul during the 2021 Taliban takeover. Each new weekly half-hour episode of Dars will air four times a day, Saturday to Friday, on the newly launched BBC News Afghanistan channel. The programme will also be available via BBC News Pashto and BBC News Dari Facebook channels, will be part of the BBC Persian TV channel schedule, and will air on radio through the network of BBC FM transmitters in Afghanistan as well as on short-wave and medium-wave radio. Aalia Farzan is one of the Dari language presenters. ""Every day I speak to a lot of Afghan girls who are still in the country and they tell me they cannot go to school,"" she says. ""They are very helpless and sometimes they seem hopeless."" The Taliban have said that schools for girls are temporarily closed until a ""suitable environment"" is created. They have also said the international community's decision to freeze aid payments means they do not have the money to spend on female-only classrooms. The BBC show is tailored to children aged between 11 and 16 and makes the most of the BBC's existing teaching content, adapting maths, history, science, and Information and Communications Technology modules from BBC Bitesize, the BBC's free online resource for pupils in the UK. Mariam Aman is one of the programme's producers and says that adapting BBC Bitesize content for an Afghan audience went beyond translation. ""Do a boy or girl living in rural Afghanistan know what pizza is when we are talking about fractions in maths or should we keep it as big round bread?"" The team also wanted to make the programme feel like home. ""Afghans are fond of chess and you would often find a chess set in most family homes,"" she says. ""We wanted to add that cultural heritage to our programme and have things like that on set."" When BBC Afghan presenter Shazia Haya was growing up, school attendance was a source of tension. ""I had just finished 12 years of school and my older brother and father were saying: 'That's enough for you. You should get married.'"" The Pashto presenter lives with their disapproval to this day. ""Even now, if you ask my father what I studied at university or what was my favourite subject in school, he doesn't know because he wasn't interested in my education, just because I'm a girl,"" she says. It was the women in Shazia's family, including her mother, who encouraged her to attend university. ""That's why this new BBC programme means a lot to me,"" she says. ""I know what the value of education is, and I know how hard it is when you don't have support."" Aalia was born in 1996, the year the Taliban first took control of Afghanistan. Despite an official ban on girls' education at the time, there was a glimmer of hope for her. She grew up in the northern province of Takhar where girls continued to attend class, and her father was a teacher. But like so many Afghans, tragedy hit her family. ""My father was killed 16 years ago,"" she says. ""He wanted me to be a journalist and I wanted to be a teacher because my father was a teacher. ""So by joining this programme, I'm fulfilling both my father's dream and my own dream."" Aalia says she often thinks of members of her extended family, especially young school-age girls, who are still in Afghanistan. ""Sometimes I put myself in their shoes, and I think that if I was in the country and I was a teenage girl who cannot go to school, who cannot go outside the house alone, who does not have any basic rights, what should I do?"" she says. ""I would be very happy if someone helped me and taught me something.""",0

"Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have lost nearly £3m in a year since taking over Wrexham FC. But the pair have pledged to carry on backing the club, despite the financial hit. A statement on the club's website said the loss was despite turnover being up five times on the previous year, at almost £6m. Most of that was made up of matchday income, kit and sponsorship. Newly-released accounts for the 12 months to the end of last June showed a loss of £2.914m. The file, sent to Companies House, showed the figure was down to a surge in player wages and football costs. At almost £3.94m, it was almost triple the previous year's figure of £1.34m. However, accounts show the club has seen a surge in turnover - £5.972m in the year, an increase of 404% on the £1.48m in the previous year. Matchday income accounted for £2.65m, retail sales in the club shop and online raised £1.303m while sponsorship and advertising made £1.053m. The directors' report which accompanied the accounts - signed by Humphrey Ker, Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney - said the loss was disappointing, but predicted. It also said the loss to Grimsby Town in last season's play-off semi-final only ""served to strengthen the collective resolve to gain promotion"" this season. Reynolds and McElhenney originally set up a company called R.R. McReynolds LLC to buy the club for £2m in 2021. Wrexham AFC said within the year to June 2022, the firm gave a loan of £3.67m to the club, which included the funds to buy the freehold of the Racecourse ground as well as £1.2m of investment in the form of shares. The directors said there was ""no immediate pressure"" to repay the loans that funded the ground and stadium improvements and want the club to become self-sufficient. They added: ""We remain committed to playing a full part in the life of the club and making a positive difference, in every way, for the benefit of everyone in this wonderful place we have taken to our hearts.""",0

"After passing tight security and passing up the clanking gangway we meet our first passenger on the ferry that's going nowhere. Salher is just six month old. The smile that erupts across his face belies the hardship he and his 19-year-old mother Aster have endured. She explains that her son was born in Rwanda after she travelled there from Eritrea, after fleeing persecution. ""It's fine here. No problem. I want to learn Dutch and then I want to work."" We're told the Silja Europa is one of the biggest passenger ferries in the world, able to carry up to 3,000 travellers. But for the past six months, it hasn't been taking people from the Estonian capital Tallinn to the Finnish capital Helsinki - its normal route. It's been a floating but stationary home to 900 asylum seekers and migrants at this dock 20km (12 miles) outside Amsterdam. With the main Dutch reception centre near the German border overflowing and heavily criticised for poor conditions, the Netherlands government has been trying something new. The UK is now exploring the same option. ""I like it here,"" says Zara, who tells us she fled her home in Chad after her first husband tried to kill her. ""In other camps we had to share a room with four or five people; it's not easy to live like that. Here, we have our own room. Conditions are much better here on the boat."" Sheza is one of seven women who has welcomed us into a corner they have commandeered and we sit on the floor and talk. Their home countries are varied - among them Syria, Pakistan and Turkey - but they all say they have been victims of violence or religious persecution. ""The Dutch have done very well, they look after us even though there are many of us in one place. It is safe, clean and comfortable, well organised. ""Food is very different from what we know, it's a different culture."" When the ferry first docked six months ago, hundreds of locals expressed anger amid fears that jobs would be taken and that local services like the doctors' surgery would be overrun. The part of the government which is running this scheme, the Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA), took on board accusations that migrants would be living a life of luxury. As we're guided around the boat, we see that six of the seven restaurants are closed off. The sauna and swimming pool are shuttered, and the casino and theatre are out-of-bounds. The conference room, decked out with comfortable-looking red felt seats, is now used to teach Dutch lessons, as well as for seminars on human rights and discussions about gender equality. Anything that may be construed as luxurious has been sealed off. But this is no cheap option. The Dutch government refuses to say how much it costs, but it's understood to be millions of euros every day. We're told that Home Office officials from the UK visited three weeks ago to see for themselves what is happening. The official UK government position is that it is still ""exploring the possibility"" of using ships to house migrants and asylum seekers arriving in Britain. I ask our guide Ronald Smallenburg from the COA what he would say to his UK counterparts in light of this Dutch experiment. ""It is indeed an expensive option. But it works. It works for the people, the residents on the ship, it works for the environment and it's a short cut solution for a serious problem."" Most of the people we spoke to as made our way round the ferry said they were grateful they are in a place which is so clean and comfortable. Anas, a Syrian decorator from Aleppo, said he was eternally grateful to the Dutch. But it's a not a universal feeling. ""It's very claustrophobic,"" says one mother who asked not to be named. ""I worry about the impact it's having on us of being in here. I miss the fresh air and being able to open our windows."" The residents are able to leave the ferry but doctors and nurses come to them if needed. This approach seems to have soothed some of that initial anger in the nearby town, specifically over fears migrants would overwhelm local services. As we step back on dry land we meet Gerry, a retired bus driver, walking her dog. ""Many people think our country is being overrun with immigrants. I don't share that view, but I do appreciate that it's a massive problem."" A massive problem which many European countries are grappling with, as a legacy of the Syrian war and most recently Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. There are no Ukrainian families aboard the Silja Europa. We're told this is because they are given a sort of protected status and priority by the local authorities. They are able to work immediately, whereas the other new arrivals must wait six months. The Dutch claim the use of the ship has been a success, but they are adamant it's not a lasting solution - and so everyone on board will be taken ashore within three months. But where they will be taken, the authorities don't know.",0
"Imagine you're a low-wage worker in India who is offered a day's employment as an extra in a Bollywood film. Your role? To go to a cash point and withdraw some money. In 2018, several men in Maharashtra state thought they were accepting a bit-part in a movie - but in fact they were being tricked into being money mules, collecting cash in an ambitious bank heist. The raid took place over a weekend in August 2018, and centred on Cosmos Co-operative bank, which has its headquarters in Pune. On a quiet Saturday afternoon, staff in the bank's head office suddenly received a string of alarming messages. They were from the card payment company Visa in the United States, warning it could see thousands of demands flooding in for large cash withdrawals from ATMs - by people apparently using Cosmos Bank cards. But when the Cosmos team checked their own systems, they saw no abnormal transactions. About half-an-hour later, just to be safe, they authorised Visa to stop all transactions from Cosmos bank cards. This delay would turn out to be extremely costly. The next day, Visa shared the full list of suspect transactions with the Cosmos head office: about 12,000 separate withdrawals from different ATMs around the world. The bank had lost nearly $14m (£11.5m). Warning: This article contains spoilers for the Lazarus Heist podcast It was an audacious crime characterised by its grand scale and meticulous synchronisation. Criminals had plundered ATMs in 28 different countries, including the United States, the UK, the United Arab Emirates and Russia. It all happened in the space of just two hours and 13 minutes - an extraordinary global flash mob of crime. Eventually, investigators would trace its origins back to a shadowy group of hackers who had pulled off a succession of previous stings seemingly at the behest of the North Korean state. But before they knew the wider picture, investigators at the Maharashtra cyber-crime unit were amazed to see CCTV footage of dozens of men walking up to a series of cashpoints, inserting bank cards and stuffing the notes into bags. ""We were not aware of a money mule network like this,"" says Insp Gen Brijesh Singh, who led the investigation. One gang had a handler who was monitoring the ATM transactions in real time on a laptop, Singh says. CCTV footage showed that whenever a money mule had tried to keep some of the cash for himself, the handler would spot it and gave him a hard slap. Using the CCTV footage as well as mobile phone data from the areas near the ATMs, the Indian investigators were able to arrest 18 suspects in the weeks after the raid. Most are now in prison, awaiting trial. Singh says these men weren't hardened crooks. Among those arrested were a waiter, a driver and a shoe-maker. Another had a pharmacy degree. ""They were gentle people,"" he says. Despite this, he thinks that by the time the raid happened, even the men recruited as ""extras"" knew what they were really doing. But did they know who they were working for? Investigators believe that the secretive and isolated state of North Korea was behind the heist. Hackers, North Korea and billions of dollars. Listen to The Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service with Jean Lee and Geoff White North Korea is one of the poorest nations in the world, yet a significant portion of its limited resources goes toward the building of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, activity that is banned by the UN Security Council. As a result, the UN has placed the country under onerous sanctions, making trade highly restrictive. Since coming to power 11 years ago, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has overseen an unprecedented campaign of weapons testing, including four nuclear tests and several provocative bids to test-launch intercontinental missiles. US authorities believe North Korea's government is using a group of elite hackers to break into banks and financial institutions around the world to steal the money it needs to keep the economy afloat and finance the weapons programme. The hackers, nicknamed the Lazarus Group, are believed to belong to a unit directed by North Korea's powerful military intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Cyber-security experts named the hackers after the biblical figure Lazarus, who comes back from the dead - because once their viruses get inside computer networks, they are almost impossible to kill off. The group first sprang to international prominence when then-US President Barack Obama accused North Korea of hacking into Sony Pictures Entertainment's computer network in 2014. The FBI accused hackers of waging the damaging cyber-attack in retaliation for ""The Interview"", a comedy that depicted the assassination of Kim Jong Un. The Lazarus Group has since been accused of trying to steal $1bn (£815m) from Bangladesh's central bank in 2016, and for launching the WannaCry cyber-attack which attempted to extract ransoms from victims around the world, including the NHS in Britain. North Korea strongly denies the Lazarus Group's existence, and all allegations of state-sponsored hacking. But leading law enforcement agencies say North Korea's hacks are more advanced, more brazen and more ambitious than ever. For the Cosmos heist, the hackers used a technique known as ""jackpotting"" - so-called because getting the ATM to spill its cash is like hitting the jackpot on a slot machine. The bank's systems were initially compromised in the classic way: through a phishing email opened by an employee which infected the computer network with malware. Once inside, the hackers manipulated a bit of software - called the ATM switch - which sends messages to a bank to approve a cashpoint withdrawal. This then gave the hackers the power to allow ATM withdrawals from their accomplices anywhere in the world. The only thing they couldn't change was the maximum amount for each withdrawal, so they needed a lot of cards and a lot of people on the ground. In preparation for the raid, they worked with accomplices to create ""cloned"" ATM cards - using genuine bank account data to create duplicate cards that can be used in ATMs. British security company BAE Systems immediately suspected it was the work of the Lazarus Group. It had been monitoring them for months and knew they were plotting to attack an Indian bank. It just didn't know which one. ""It would have been too much of a coincidence for it to have been another criminal operation,"" says BAE security researcher Adrian Nish. The Lazarus Group are versatile and very ambitious, he says. ""Most criminal groups would probably be happy enough to get away with a couple of million and stop at that."" The logistics involved in the Cosmos Bank heist are staggering. How did the hackers find accomplices on the ground in 28 countries, including many that North Korean citizens can't legally visit? US tech security investigators believe the Lazarus Group met one key facilitator on the dark web, where there are entire forums dedicated to swapping hacking skills and where criminals often sell support services. In February 2018, a user calling himself Big Boss posted tips on how to carry out credit card fraud. He also said he had the equipment to make cloned ATM cards, and that he had access to a group of money mules in the United States and Canada. This was precisely the service the Lazarus Group needed for their hit on Cosmos Bank, and they started working with Big Boss. We asked Mike DeBolt, chief intelligence officer at Intel 471 - a tech security firm in the US - to find out more about this accomplice. DeBolt's team discovered that Big Boss had been active for at least 14 years and had a string of aliases: G, Habibi, and Backwood. The security sleuths managed to link him to all these usernames, as he used the same email address in different forums. ""Basically, he's being lazy,"" says DeBolt. ""We see this pretty commonly: actors change their alias on a forum, but keep the same email address."" In 2019, Big Boss was arrested in the United States and unmasked as Ghaleb Alaumary, a 36-year-old Canadian. He pleaded guilty to offences including laundering funds from alleged North Korean bank heists, and was sentenced to 11 years, eight months. North Korea has never admitted any involvement in the Cosmos Bank job, or any other hacking scheme. The BBC put allegations of involvement in the Cosmos attack to North Korea's embassy in London but received no reply. However, when we contacted him previously, ambassador Choe Il replied the allegations of North Korean state-sponsored hacking and money laundering are ""a farce"", and an attempt by the US to ""tarnish the image of our state"". In February 2021, the FBI, the US Secret Service and Department of Justice announced charges against three suspected Lazarus Group hackers: Jon Chang Hyok, Kim Il and Park Jin Hyok, whom they said work for North Korea's military intelligence agency. They are now thought to be back in Pyongyang. US and South Korean authorities estimate North Korea has up to 7,000 trained hackers. It is unlikely that they all work from inside the country, where few people have permission to use the internet, making users' activities difficult to conceal. Instead, they're often sent overseas. Ryu Hyeon Woo, a former North Korean diplomat and one of the most senior people to have left the regime, provided insight into how the hackers work abroad. In 2017, he was working at the North Korean embassy in Kuwait, helping to oversee the employment of some 10,000 North Koreans in the region. At the time, many were working on construction sites across the Gulf and, like all North Korean workers, were required to hand over most of their wages to the regime. He said his office received a daily call from a North Korean handler who was overseeing 19 hackers living and working in cramped quarters in Dubai. ""That's really all they need: a computer that's connected to the internet,"" he said. North Korea denies having any hackers posted abroad, only IT workers with valid visas. But Mr Ryu's description fits with FBI allegations about how these cyber-units operate from dormitories around the world. In September 2017, the UN Security Council imposed the strictest sanctions yet on North Korea, limiting fuel imports, further restricting exports, and demanding that UN member nations send North Korean workers home by December 2019. Yet the hackers still appear to be active. They are now targeting crypto-currency companies, and are estimated to have stolen close to $3.2 bn. US authorities have called them ""the world's leading bank robbers"", using ""keyboards rather than guns"".",0
"It is not often that hardened news photographers and camera crews are surprised, but when the Duke of Sussex emerged from a black cab at the Royal Courts of Justice on Monday morning, their muttered expletives told their own story. Prince Harry offered a ""morning, hi guys"" to the pack, and breezed into court. He had quietly flown back to the UK to make what had clearly been planned as a dramatic entrance. No-one had expected him to appear in person for a week of what were billed to be complex legal arguments about whether seven well-known people should be allowed to sue Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail titles. The duke's manifesto is clear. As he writes in his book, Spare, ""it's about not letting people get away with abuse, and lies. Especially the kind of lies that can destroy innocents"". For several days he sat on the padded seats of court 76 listening to what was said, writing in a black notebook and occasionally passing notes to his lawyers. The actor Sadie Frost sat next to him, another of the seven. Journalists, a breed the duke appears to loathe, sat yards away, and it became routine to file out of the court for lunch breaks with Prince Harry and his close protection detail joining the hungry queue for the exit. Also there at times were Sir Elton John, his husband David Furnish, and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, who, along with Sir Simon Hughes and Elizabeth Hurley, are also claiming breaches of privacy by the newspapers. They seemed prepared to endure the more uncomfortable plastic seats of the court - although Mr Furnish seemed to have more stamina than Sir Elton. The allegations are eye-watering. Nineteen private investigators are alleged to have placed phone taps on landlines, taped microphones to windows, bugged cars, intercepted voicemail, blagged information ranging from bank statements to flight details, and put their targets under surveillance. They are said to have worked for around 80 journalists on the two Associated Newspapers titles. The publisher denies the allegations, branding the claims ""preposterous smears"". The venue was appropriate. Eleven years ago, in the identical court 73 one floor below, Lord Justice Leveson heard months of evidence during his public inquiry into press standards, relevant to the current case in two important ways. First, in front of Lord Justice Leveson, Associated Newspapers repeatedly denied on oath that it had commissioned illegal methods of gathering private information. Second, the inquiry was given records of payments made by the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday to private investigators. During this week's hearings the judge was considering whether the payment records, held confidentially by the Leveson Inquiry, could be used in this case, and whether the whole thing should be thrown out because of a legal time limit. Barristers for the seven said they had been put off taking legal action because of the vehement denials by the newspapers at the public inquiry. Only recently, they argued, had real evidence come forward. This case is hugely important because Associated Newspapers has always strongly denied paying for this sort of illegal newsgathering. A decade after law firms began suing rival titles The Sun, News of the World, and Mirror for millions in damages resulting from phone hacking, Associated Newspapers has remained untouched. The publisher's reputation is at stake - and its bottom line. News UK, which owns The Sun, has paid an estimated £1bn in damages and legal costs during the hacking cases. Should Associated Newspapers lose this case, sources close to the law firms mounting the legal challenge say there are dozens more famous people waiting to sue. Associated Newspapers, represented during the hearings by two ""silks"", or senior barristers, and a row of lawyers frantically scribbling in notebooks or tapping on tablets, has not been shy about proclaiming its innocence. The publisher has described the claims as a ""pre-planned and orchestrated attempt"" to drag the Mail titles into the phone-hacking scandal by a coalition of journalists and anti-press campaigners. ""Unsubstantiated"", ""highly defamatory"", and a ""fishing expedition"", the company says of the potential evidence. It could take years to resolve. Mr Justice Nicklin, regarded as one of the judiciary's leading media judges, promised on Thursday to decide as quickly as he could whether this case can continue, but in the law, quickly almost certainly means weeks. And that's just the start.  Should the judge keep the case alive, the claimants will be able to get disclosure of key documents. There will be battles about that process. This video can not be played Watch: Harry bumps into photographer outside court There are likely to be skirmishes about which evidence should be heard in the case. One private investigator, Gavin Burrows, made a witness statement in 2021 making lurid admissions of his ""unlawful"" activities on behalf of the newspapers. By 2023 his story appeared to have changed. He had never worked for the Mail and Mail on Sunday, he said in a new statement. Listening to some of the potential evidence this week, there was a feeling of looking back on a different era - where the landline phone number of a celebrity was journalistic gold dust to a showbiz reporter. A time where it is alleged cassette recorders were used to secretly record phone calls, taped to the inside of a junction box. A time when tabloid scandals were delivered on newsprint. The world has changed. Much of the information it is claimed newspapers were desperate to get their hands on is now freely available on social media - published by the celebrities themselves.",0
"Turkey's parliament has approved Finland's bid to join Nato, meaning the way is now clear to join the bloc. Nato is a the defensive alliance of North American and European countries whose members are currently helping Ukraine in its war against Russia. Finland applied to join the bloc last year, along with its neighbour Sweden, because it was concerned about Russian aggression. Turkey was the last country to approve its entry. Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in 1949 by 12 countries, including the US, UK, Canada and France. It currently has 30 members, who agree to help one another if they come under attack. The organisation's original goal was to challenge Russian expansion in Europe after World War Two. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many of the Eastern European countries which used to be its allies in the Warsaw Pact were granted Nato membership. Russia has long argued that Nato's acceptance of Eastern European countries threatens its security. It has vehemently opposed Ukraine's request to join the alliance, fearing this would encroach too closely on its territory. Finland has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia, while Sweden faces it across the Baltic Sea. For seven decades, both thought it safer to remain non-aligned rather than to join Nato in opposition to Russia. But after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, they both asked to be given entry to the alliance as soon as possible. The two countries would add 280,000 troops (including reservists) to Nato's combined forces, and more than 200 combat aircraft. All current Nato members have to approve new countries joining through votes in their parliaments. Hungary and Turkey were the last countries to vote for Finland's entry. Hungary did so on 27 March and Turkey on 30 March. When Finland and Sweden applied to join Nato, Turkey's government complained that they had been harbouring Turkish citizens who it calls ""terrorists"". It demanded their extradition. Since Sweden was the main focus of Turkey's complaints, Finland negotiated a settlement with Turkey on its own. It now hopes it will be able to join Nato in time for the bloc's July summit in Lithuania. However, Turkey is still criticising Sweden for harbouring ""Kurdish militants"" and neither Turkey's nor Hungary's governments have yet asked their parliaments to approve its entry. Many of the alliance's member states have provided Ukraine with weapons and ammunition to help it defend itself against Russia.. The US is sending 31 Abrams tanks, the UK 14 Challenger 2 tanks, Germany 14 Leopard 2 tanks and Norway eight Leopard 2 tanks. The US has also sent armoured fighting vehicles such as the Stryker and the Bradley. In addition, the US and UK have sent Ukraine long-range missile systems such as Himars, which have been striking targets behind Russia's front lines. Several Nato countries have provided howitzers and self-propelled guns, while Turkey has sold Ukraine several Bayraktar TB2 armed drones. The US and others have supplied air defence systems to shoot down Russian cruise missiles and drones over Ukraine. The anti-tank weapons that the US and UK have supplied, such as Javelin and Nlaw, were crucial in turning back Russia's advance on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in spring 2022. Nato countries are also aiming to ramp up their supplies of artillery shells and ammunition to Ukraine. Poland and Slovakia are sending Ukraine Soviet-era Mig fighter jets, but Nato countries are not sending the US-made F-16s it has been asking for. Nato countries also fear that if Ukraine were to use these jets to strike targets inside Russia, it could draw them deeper into the war. Nato countries are not sending their troops to Ukraine, or imposing a no-fly zone over the country, again for fear of provoking a direct conflict with Russia. However, Nato countries have now stationed 40,000 troops in eastern Europe - on the territory of alliance members such as Lithuania and Poland. They also have another 300,000 troops on high alert in Europe. Nato told Ukraine in 2008 that it could join the bloc at some point in the future, but declined its recent request for ""fast-track"" membership. This is because Article 5 of the Nato charter says that if one member is attacked, all members should come to its defence. If Ukraine was made a member, Nato countries would technically have to go to war with Russia.",0
"Donald Trump has become the first former US president to face criminal charges, for alleged hush money payments made to a porn star just before the 2016 presidential election. But he is facing numerous lawsuits as well and it can be difficult to keep track of the investigations. Here are four that could have the biggest impact on him both personally and politically. What's being investigated? A grand jury has voted to indict the former president after New York prosecutors investigated a $130,000 pay-out to former adult star Stormy Daniels. The charges have not yet been made public. Ms Daniels claims she and Mr Trump had sex, and that she accepted the money from his former lawyer before the 2016 election in exchange for her silence on the encounter. Mr Trump has always denied they had sexual relations. Meanwhile, the business practices of his family company, the Trump Organization, are being examined by prosecutors. Letitia James, the New York attorney general, is leading a civil investigation (which cannot result in criminal charges) and has spent years looking at whether the company committed various acts of fraud over several decades. A criminal investigation is being led by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and is looking at similar issues. What has Trump said? Mr Trump has described the indictment in the Stormy Daniels case as ""political persecution"" and said he doesn't expect a fair trial. He is expected to appear in court on Tuesday, where he will be presented with the charges and enter a plea. Separately, the former president and his lawyers have insisted the allegations against the Trump Organization are politically motivated. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised both Ms James and Mr Bragg. So how serious is it? Although details of the charges in the Stormy Daniels case are yet to be disclosed, it will be the first criminal case ever brought against a former US president. The criminal investigation into the Trump Organization has already yielded convictions. The company was found guilty in December of fraud and falsifying business records and fined $1.6m (£1.31m). Allen Weisselberg, the organisation's chief financial officer, was sentenced to five months in jail in January. In the civil case, Ms James has filed a lawsuit against Mr Trump and three of his children accusing them of ""astounding"" fraud and deception. The lawsuit alleges that the family inflated their net worth by billions, and is seeking $250m (£226m) that was allegedly obtained through fraudulent means. It's also seeking bans on Mr Trump and his children from serving in a leadership role in any New York business. A Manhattan judge has denied Mr Trump's bid to delay the trial, saying the scheduled date of 2 October is ""written in stone"". What's being investigated? The Department of Justice is looking into the removal of government documents from the White House, which were then taken to Mr Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, after he left office. Investigators are assessing how these documents were stored and who may have had access to them. The former president's sprawling beachside property was searched in August and 11,000 documents were seized, including around 100 marked as classified. Some of these were labelled top secret. Unsurprisingly, we know very little about what's in the documents at this stage. But classified material usually contains information that officials feel could damage national security if made public. What has Trump said? He's denied wrongdoing and criticised the justice department's investigation, branding it ""politically motivated"" and a ""witch-hunt"". He has offered shifting defences which have mostly hinged on the argument that he declassified the material. No evidence has yet been provided that this is true. The former president has also argued that some of the documents are protected by ""privilege"" - a legal concept that would prevent them from being used in future proceedings. An independent lawyer is reviewing the seized material to determine if this is the case and that process continues. But Mr Trump has not directly addressed the key question of why the documents were at Mar-a-Lago in the first place. So how serious is it? This is an active criminal investigation and could result in charges being filed. Among other statutes, the justice department believes Mr Trump may have violated the Espionage Act by keeping national security information that ""could be used to the injury of the United States"". In addition to charges relating to the classified documents themselves, prosecutors are also looking at obstruction of justice as another potential crime. Mr Trump's team are now locked in a legal battle with the justice department over the investigation. The department has appointed an independent lawyer, or special counsel, to oversee all of its criminal investigations into Mr Trump. Jack Smith will lead its various inquiries and will ultimately decide whether to bring charges. What's being investigated? Mr Trump's alleged role in the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, when a mob of his supporters stormed the building in an effort to stop the confirmation of President Joe Biden's election victory, is under scrutiny from several federal government bodies. The most visible has been a congressional committee that spent 18 months looking into Mr Trump's actions. They held a series of televised hearings laying out their case that his election fraud claims led directly to the riot. Following these hearings, the committee accused Mr Trump of inciting insurrection and other crimes. The justice department is running a separate criminal probe into 6 January and broader efforts to overturn the election - but this has largely been shrouded in secrecy. It's the largest police investigation in US history, but the extent to which Mr Trump is a target is unclear. What has Trump said? He's denied responsibility for the riot and criticised the congressional committee, which he described as a ""kangaroo court"" and ""unselect pseudo-committee"". He has continued to repeat his unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud. So how serious is it? The congressional committee - made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans - concluded its hearings by recommending four criminal charges against Mr Trump which it then referred to the justice department. The move was largely symbolic as it is up to the department to decide whether to file criminal charges. There is no indication this is imminent. This video can not be played Watch the moment Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol building The justice department's criminal probe, however, has already led to hundreds of people who stormed the Capitol being charged. The former president has not been called for questioning in that inquiry, but it remains a possibility. He could also - in theory - be charged if investigators believe there is sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. What's being investigated? Prosecutors spent eight months looking into alleged attempts to overturn Mr Trump's narrow loss in the state in the 2020 presidential election. The criminal investigation was opened after the disclosure of an hour-long phone call between the former president and the state's top election official on 2 January 2021. ""I just want to find 11,780 votes,"" Mr Trump said during the call to Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger - a reference to the number of ballots needed to give him victory in the swing state. A grand jury investigating the case was dissolved earlier this year after filing a final report, which remains sealed. What has Trump said? He's described the investigation - as he has many others - as a ""witch hunt"". Mr Trump has also attacked the legal official leading the inquiry - the chief prosecutor of Fulton County, Fani Willis - as a ""young, ambitious, Radical Left Democrat... who is presiding over one of the most Crime Ridden and Corrupt places"". So how serious is it? ""The allegations are very serious. If indicted and convicted, people are facing prison sentences,"" Ms Willis told the Washington Post last month. The 26-member grand jury did not have indictment powers but may have recommended charges.  Among the potential crimes it looked into were the solicitation of election fraud, making false statements to government officials, and racketeering. It is not known whether the former president is being directly investigated, but some of his allies are known to be part of the inquiry. For a criminal conviction, however, prosecutors would ultimately need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that those involved knew their actions were fraudulent. In January, a prosecutor working on behalf of Fulton County said the district attorney's office believes the report should only be released after prosecutors determine whether or not to bring charges.",0
"For the past few weeks, Thommamoon Khowasat has painstakingly explained to his four year-old daughter that the yellow cloud they see outside their window - which has tickled her imagination - is actually a danger to her health. It's a scare that has gripped northern Thailand where millions of people are currently finding it harder to breathe. Widespread farm burning and forest fires have created a smog that's even thicker than usual, which is choking communities and exposing them to respiratory disease. In the tourist-favoured Chiang Rai province, and even the capital Bangkok, people have been on edge checking the air quality levels every day. ""I feel very sorry for my daughter,"" said Thommamoon, who has not seen haze this thick in the 20 years he has lived in Chiang Rai. ""As a child she doesn't know. She thinks that it's natural fog. But the truth is a poisonous mist."" The girl is under strict orders to stay at home, but even indoors and with an air purifier whirring away, the air quality is compromised. This video can not be played Drone footage captures thick smog choking Chiang Rai At Chiang Rai's Mae Chan Hospital, Dr. Veera Isarathanan fears for newborns who are exposed to the air pollution. Babies can't wear face masks, and even with a purifier machine, the air in the nursery can be hazardous. ""[It's sad] newborn children have to encounter pollution like this. Their lungs are just starting to work,"" Dr Isarathanan said. Thailand's air pollution is an issue year each year in the dry season - which typically runs from November to March - mainly due to seasonal burning from farmers clearing their sugarcane and rice fields. But the smog has been particularly bad this year. On 10 March, Thai health authorities reported that in the first nine weeks of the year, more than 1.3 million people had already suffered air pollution-related diseases. Nearly 200,000 of these cases were reported in the first week of March - when the haze had started to worsen. In Chiang Rai, the haze has grown so thick to obscure its famous mountains, and what is usually lush, green foliage appears grey. Drone footage passing over the city's parks and streets show them near unrecognisable, with buildings reduced to smoky outlines. The levels of the hazardous PM 2.5 particles have also soared - these are particles are small enough to be be breathed into lungs and even enter bloodstreams. Exposure to PM 2.5 dust can cause burning and itching in the eyes and skin,  as well as coughing and chest tightness. These symptoms can be amplified for those who have pre-existing heart or lung conditions. In Chiang Rai, fire trucks were this week deployed to blast water into the air to clear the dust. But it's only a short-term measure. Authorities have warned that the grim scenario will persist for the coming days, with few winds forecast that could blow the dust away. On Monday, about 200 people in the Chiang Rai district of Mae Sai protested outside a local government office demanding authorities take action. ""Nowadays, Mae Sai people live in misery. Both young and old, living in hardship,"" said one of the demonstrators, Somyot Nittayaroj. Somyot said the haze had gotten worse in the last two to three years. The day of the protest, the air quality in parts of Chiang Rai was nearly 125 times over the limit deemed safe by the World Health Organization. Protesters said Thailand should negotiate with Myanmar and other neighbouring countries where agricultural burning has contributed to the smog. Satellite data showed that many of fire hot spots were located in Myanmar, followed by Laos. Fires were also spotted in Cambodia and Vietnam. However a majority of the pollution still comes from closer sources. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has directed lawmakers to go after perpetrators of forest fires and there are laws in place curtailing agricultural burning. But the problem is most of these restrictions are ignored. For farmers, burning their plot is often the easiest and cheapest method to clear land.",0
"In mid-February, a daily wage worker died in a hospital in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, days after he was picked up by the police in connection with a case of robbery. Mohammed Khadeer was detained because the police found he resembled the suspect in CCTV footage. Five days later, Khadeer was freed because the police were unsure whether they had the right man. But later, he died in hospital after recording a video in which he blamed his condition on torture in custody, a claim the police denied. Khadeer was possibly detained because of dodgy footage. ""The CCTV footage was not very clear because it was evening and it was dark,"" a police officer told Moneycontrol. There are more than 1.5 million security cameras across 15 cities in India, according to Comparitech, a UK-based cyber security and privacy research firm. A combined population of 135.8 million in these cities works out to an average of 11 cameras per 1,000 people. Citizens believe they help reduce crime - though some studies show they are more useful in solving crimes than preventing them - but civil liberties groups warn of the perils of mass surveillance. Some Indian cities are bristling with more cameras than others. Hyderabad has nearly 42 cameras per 1,000 people. Indore had the highest - 63 per 1,000 people. These two cities, along with the capital Delhi (26.7 cameras) and Chennai (24.53 cameras), were among the top most surveilled cities in the world, according to Comparitech. Demand for CCTV cameras is also rising. Last July, just one firm - Godrej Security Solutions - reported a 40% rise in sales over 2022. Driving through the countryside in the northern state of Bihar recently, I found cameras placed on heaps of bricks in soot-laden kilns that were spewing smoke and powering the country's construction boom. They were keeping an eye on poor farmers who were making bricks. Thanks to plummeting prices, even a few homes had cameras outside the main door. ""It's a status symbol now,"" a villager told me. A new report by Common Cause, a non-profit group, in collaboration with Lokniti-CSDS, a polling group, appears to reaffirm this enthusiasm for surveillance among Indians. The study - based on interviews with more than 9,700 people in 12 states - finds a ""high level of public support for certain forms of government surveillance"". It found that one in two respondents had installed CCTVs in their households and neighbourhoods. Affluent people were more than three times more likely to have CCTV coverage in their neighbourhoods, compared with slums and poor neighbourhoods. More educated people believed that CCTV worked for crime reduction and public safety and less as a tool for mass surveillance. Three out of four respondents strongly believed that CCTVs helped monitor and reduce crime - except that the jury is out on this much-vaunted claim. Research by Comparitech found little - if any - correlation between the number of cameras and crime rates. In Indore, where the cameras per 1,000 people was the highest, the crime index - the estimated overall level of crime in the city - was slightly higher than in Kozhikode in Kerala which had a mere 0.05 cameras per 100,000 people. ""This trend is something we witnessed across the board in our study, demonstrating that more CCTV cameras don't necessarily mean lower crime rates,"" Rebecca Moody of Comparitech told me. Governments were also three times more likely to install CCTV cameras in slums and poor areas compared with high-income neighbourhoods, the Common Cause-Lokniti report found. The poor were least likely to support the installation of CCTVs at any location - entry of homes, inside the house or at places of work. ""There is a difference between the middle class and the rich public's perception, who are more likely to support surveillance. The poor, on the other hand, are more likely to view it critically, perhaps because they are more often at the receiving end of the state's ire,"" the report said. What accounts for India's love for CCTVs, a shorthand for what appears to be a wholehearted embrace of surveillance and surrender of the right to privacy? Cameras may make people safer, but the lack of regulation around their use and storage of data does pose a ""serious threat to citizens' privacy, especially when things like facial recognition are used in conjunction with these systems"", said Ms Moody. The report also found that two out of the three people had not heard of the 2021 Pegasus spyware issue in which activists, journalists, politicians and lawyers around the world - including 30 reportedly from India - were allegedly targeted with phone spyware sold to governments by an Israeli firm. A previous study had found that support for internet shutdowns by governments to maintain law and order was ""also greater than opposition to it"". According to SFLC.in, a Delhi-based legal advocacy group, authorities in India have shut down mobile-phone or broadband networks more than 700 times - to quell protests, stamp out unrest and stop exam cheating, among other things - since 2012.  (More than 400 of these shutdowns have happened in restive Jammu and Kashmir.) Apar Gupta of the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital-rights organisation, said that the right to privacy in India was a work in progress. ""Many Indians have embraced technology uncritically. The problem is not technology, it's about how we are using it. Our ideas of economic, political and civil rights are still to take deep roots,"" Mr Gupta said. BBC News India is now on YouTube.
